For CORGS 2021, we built a controller specifically for everyone's favorite boxing game, Punch Out.

We took apart a DDR pad, and used that to make punchable areas on the dummy and a pad for dodging left and right. We added a button on the top of the head to do the uppercut.

The hardest part was some custom Arduino programming to make the face buttons be `up+A` and `up+B` instead of single button inputs.

Fun times at the show with everyone punching it's lights out.
