The Columbus Ohio Retro Gaming Society Convention for 2022 has a new entry for the Nintendo Entertainment System (and Famicom).

If you're interested in going to a video game convention, then it only stands to reason that you're even more interested in playing a video game about going to such a convention.

Explore the CORGS-con and find hidden video games and references. Throw money at video games and maybe even find the KING OF VIDEO GAMES himself!
