## Fill'er up!

A new zapper game for the Nintendo Entertainment System in 2023.

The universe is in peril! Heros are called into action, but you have a simpler calling, that of a pump jockey. Unleaded, Diesel, you can pump it all!

Practice pumping gas to the perfect number, ignore all the distractions , and see if you can make a difference in the universe!

This game uses a never before seen feature of the NES Zapper, the button hold. Other games wait for the trigger to release to 'fire', but G.A.S. requires you to _hold_ the button, but don't *click* it!

What do you have in the tank? Are you up to the task? It's GAS! Zarkaq awaits!
